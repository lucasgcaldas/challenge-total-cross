### Exercise 1: Boom

In this first exercise, initially in the main, three arrays were declared and then passed as parameters to the sevenBoom function. In this function I used a for loop to parse the array and check if each number contains the digit 7, through an Integer to String transformation. If yes, print "Boom", if not, "there is no 7 in the array".

### Exercise 2: CamelCaseOrSnakeCase

In this second exercise, initially in the main, four strings were passed as parameters to the toCamelCase or toSnakeCase function. In the toCamelCase function I used the split method to split the string at "underscore" and then built a List, analyzing if there is two or more words to convert to camel case and then printing it in camel case. In the toSnakeCase function I used the split method to split the string at any upper case letter and then separate in firstLtr and restLtrs strings. After this the firstLtr is converted to lower case, then concatenated and printed with the "underscore" and restLtrs.

### Exercise 3: ConsecutiveNumbers

In this third exercise, initially in the main, three arrays were declared and then passed as parameters to the cons function. The cons function sorts the arrays into ascending numerical order and then analizes if the current number plus one is different from the next number. If yes, print "false", if not, print "true".


### Exercise 4: LargestGap

In this fourth exercise, initially in the main, three arrays were declared and then passed as parameters to the largestGap function. In the largestGap function I declared a variable int starting with 0 and made a List using a for loop which collects the differences between the next value and the current value. Then, the function analizes which is the largest gap and prints it.

### Exercise 5: PrimeNumbers

In this fifth exercise, initially in the main, three numbers were passed as parameters to the primeNumbers function. This function builds a List and then, with a for loop, to analyze how many and which prime numbers are in the sequence
